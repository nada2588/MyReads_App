# MyReads Project

This project from Udacity.




## Overview

In the MyReads project, I created a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that I used to persist information as the user interacts with the application.



## Specification

As a starting point, I was given a starter static template without any of the React code that was needed to complete the project. My job was be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.



## How to run the project

To run the project, download zip file , extract it 

and follow the instructions below.


* install all project dependencies with 

        npm install
* start the development server with 

        npm start

Please note that the backend server -against which the web app was developped- was provided by Udacity. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods I used to perform necessary operations on the backend.
